The Little Prince — A Paraphrased Summary (Educational Version)

Once upon a time, a young pilot crash-landed in the Sahara Desert. His plane was damaged, and he had only a few days of water left. While trying to repair his engine, he was suddenly awakened by a small voice saying, “Please, draw me a sheep.” The pilot was astonished to see a little boy with golden hair, dressed as if from another world. This boy was the Little Prince.

The Little Prince came from a tiny planet, no bigger than a house. He loved his small world deeply, caring for three volcanoes and a single rose that he cherished. But the rose was vain and demanding, and one day, the Little Prince decided to leave his planet to explore the universe and learn about life.

As he traveled, he visited many small planets, each inhabited by a single grown-up. He met a king who ruled over nothing, a vain man who only wanted to be admired, a drunkard who drank to forget his shame, a businessman obsessed with counting stars, and a lamplighter who worked tirelessly without questioning why. Each encounter taught the Little Prince something about the strange ways of adults.

Finally, he reached Earth and met a fox. The fox taught him an important secret: “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” The Little Prince learned that love, friendship, and caring make someone truly unique and irreplaceable.

When the Little Prince decided to return to his rose, he asked a snake to help him leave his body behind and go back to his planet. The pilot, who had grown to love his small friend, was heartbroken. But he knew that somewhere among the stars, the Little Prince was smiling again with his beloved rose.

This story reminds us that grown-ups often forget what truly matters, while children see clearly with their hearts. The Little Prince remains a timeless symbol of innocence, love, and the wisdom of seeing with the heart.
